# HackerRank Weekly Challenges
This repository contains my solutions to the weekly challenges on HackerRank. All solutions are implemented in C++.

## Structure

Each week's challenge will be organized in its own directory:

```
/week-1
    /challenge-1
    /challenge-2
/week-2
    /challenge-1
    /challenge-2
...
```

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- CMake (optional, for building projects)
- Visual Studio Code (optional, for development)
- C++ extension for Visual Studio Code

## How to Run

### Using Command Line

1. Navigate to the challenge directory:
    ```sh
    cd week-1/challenge-1
    ```

2. Compile the C++ code:
    ```sh
    g++ -o main main.cpp
    ```

3. Run the executable:
    ```sh
    ./main
    ```

### Using Visual Studio Code

1. Open the challenge directory in Visual Studio Code:
    ```sh
    code week-1/challenge-1
    ```

2. Ensure you have the C++ extension installed. You can find it in the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`), and search for "C++".

3. Open the `main.cpp` file and press `F5` to build and run the code. You might need to configure the `tasks.json` and `launch.json` files for the first time.
